A Sprite Kit  Sloppy Flappy Bird Clone

--------------------------------
While the whole world went crazy with a quite boring, but temendously difficult game, 
I was busy studying Functional Programming an iOS.
Just the day before the author pulled it down from the store, I downloaded it and after a couple of games, 
I wondered how much time I would had need to create a simple clone using Sprite Kit.
So, I waited mi kids went to bed and I created a new project with AppCode...

-------------
Ok, first implementation done!
Not perfect, code is definitely bad, but for a few hours project is good!
The app is still in progress, next step clean code, add sensor to count the number of pipes passed.
